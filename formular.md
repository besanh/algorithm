# Common formular use in DSA

## Find mid in array

`mid := (left + right)/2`


## Find mid in array, string,...

`mid := left + (right - left)/2`
Use cases:
I use this formular when I working with large numbers, preventing overflow when left and right are large integers

Example:
`n=10`

`left = 1`

`mid = 1 + (10-1)/2 = 5`
